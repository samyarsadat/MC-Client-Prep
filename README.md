----
This is a little program for setting up a Minecraft client (download and install mods, mod-loaders, resource packs, etc.) to play on a multiplayer server based on a server description file (see [specification](docs/server_manifest_file/srv_manifest_spec.md)).

This is my first time using Go, and this project is really just an excuse for me to mess around with Go a bit. It's currently nowhere near completed, and I doubt I'll ever complete it. As I said, it's just an excuse for me to mess around with Go.
